# Pocketcasts Backup

A Cloudflare Worker that backs up your Pocket Casts listen history to a D1 database. It runs on an hourly cron, and provides a web UI to browse your history and export it as CSV.

## Features

- Automatically syncs your listen history every hour
- Stores episode data in Cloudflare D1
- Web interface to browse recent episodes with progress tracking
- CSV export of your full history
- Manual backup trigger via `/backup`

## Deploy to Cloudflare

### Prerequisites

- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- A [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) account

### Steps

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottrobertson/pocketcast-backup.git
cd pocketcast-backup
npm install
```

2. Log in to Cloudflare:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

3. Create a D1 database:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create pocketcasts-history
```

4. Copy the example wrangler config and add your database ID from the previous step:

```bash
cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
```

Update the `database_id` in `wrangler.toml` with the ID output from step 3.

5. Set your Pocket Casts credentials as secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put EMAIL
npx wrangler secret put PASS
```

6. Deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The database table is created automatically on the first backup run.

## Endpoints

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `/backup` | Triggers a backup manually |
| `/history?password=YOUR_PASS` | Browse your listen history |
| `/export?password=YOUR_PASS` | Download your full history as CSV |

The `/history` and `/export` endpoints are protected by your Pocket Casts password.

## Local Development

Copy the example config and create a `.dev.vars` file with your credentials:

```bash
cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
cp .env.example .dev.vars
```

Edit `.dev.vars` with your Pocket Casts email and password, then start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
